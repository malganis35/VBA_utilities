In [#datascience](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=datascience&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6819505075812151296), the similarity measure gauge how data samples are related or closed to each other.

Defining similarity measures is a requirement for some [#machinelearning](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=machinelearning&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6819505075812151296) methods. In such methods, the similarity measure is used to retrieve the stored case or set of cases most similar to the query case.

Describing a similarity measure analytically is challenging, even for domain experts working with experts. However, data sets are typically gathered as part of the machine learning system. These datasets are assumed to contain the features that correctly identify the solution from the problem features. Therefore, they may also contain the knowledge to construct or learn such a similarity measure.

Similarity measure or similarity function is a real-valued function that quantifies the similarity between two objects.  Even though no single definition of a similarity measure exists, such measures are usually inverse of distance metrics.

Distance measures are the fundamental principle for classification, like the kNN classifier, which measures the dissimilarity between given data samples.

The similarity between two objects is a numerical measure of the degree to which the two objects are alike. Similarities are usually non-negative and are often between 0 (no similarity) and 1(complete similarity).

The concept of similarity is fundamentally important in almost every scientific field. Listing all the uses of similarity is impossible.

Feature-Based Similarity Measures

The perceived similarity is the result of a feature-matching process that differentially weights common and distinct stimulus features.

Probabilistic Similarity Measures

All similarity measures considered so far assume that repeated presentation of the same stimulus always elicits the same percept â€“ that is, they assume that the percept is deterministic. But many theorists have argued that the information that forms a percept varies over time, and thus that percepts are probabilistic.

Classification of Similarity Models

Similarity models differ according to whether they assume the percept is deterministic or probabilistic. They also differ according to whether they assume that the process through which a response is selected is deterministic or probabilistic. The decision process is deterministic if the same response is always made given the same information and it is probabilistic if, for each information state, a response is selected randomly by sampling from some probability distribution.
