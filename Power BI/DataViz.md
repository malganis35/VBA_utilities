Dashboards need to start with an audience in mind. People look at the world from the perspective of their job role, their relationships, their location, and their experience. To fully connect with them, you need to understand their context and present not just data, but data that translates into meaningful information in a way that fits their needs and ability. Part of meeting the needs of your audience is having something specific to tell them. 

Understanding your clients’ mental models, i.e. their thought process and the ways they organize the information in their head can help you layout the report pages in a way that is intuitive for them. 

I find one of the better ways to lay out your dashboard is to copy the layout of a book. A title page, table of contents, chapters, bibliography/sources. Similarly, you would have a title page to your report that summarizes what the dashboard is about. Then a table of contents, to show what report pages are part of the dashboard. Each subsequent report page should have a standard layout, I would recommend laying out the report pages so that it goes into further detail as you go down the page. Lastly, I always recommend including one page towards the end of the dashboard, a page all about the sources of data for your report and any details about the data owners.

This is more formally called the guided analytics approach, which in this context means how to help your clients navigate through your dashboard. This approach materializes as follows:

🔹𝐄𝐱𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐒𝐮𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐏𝐚𝐠𝐞: Concise summaries of the data to follow.
🔹𝐅𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐬: Each key area gets its own stand alone report.
🔹𝐃𝐞𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐝/𝐃𝐫𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐓𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡 𝐏𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐬: Further details can be found in these pages. 
🔹𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐏𝐚𝐠𝐞: Exposes the data that went into making the dashboard. Gives users ability to validate and check the accuracy of the data.](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6820457762816958464/)
